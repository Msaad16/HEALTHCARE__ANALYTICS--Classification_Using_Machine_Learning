# Healthcare Analytics using Machine Learning

The recent Covid-19 Pandemic raised concerns over Healthcare Management. Patient's length of stay is a parameter which one can use to decide if the healthcare management in a hospital needs improvement. This parameter is crucial because at the time of admission, hospitals can identify those patients who have higher chances of staying at the hospital for a longer duration of days. Once identified, such patients can have their treatment plan optimized to reduce their stay and lower the chance of staff/visitor infection. Also, prior knowledge of of the length of stay can aid in logistics such as room and bed allocation planning. The aim of this project is to use machine learning to predict the length of stay for each patient on case by case basis so that the hospitals can use this information for optimal resource allocation and better functioning.
